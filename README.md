# Fundoo Notes Backend

A robust, enterprise-grade Spring Boot backend for the Fundoo Notes application.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Development
This project is being developed using a strict Use-Case (UC) driven approach. It features a completely isolated `main` branch (for documentation only) and a rigidly managed `develop` branch for code integration.

All APIs are built adhering to the core layered architectural pattern:
`Client ➡️ Controller ➡️ DTO ➡️ Service ➡️ Repository ➡️ Database`

## ✅ Phase 1 Implemented Features (UC1 - UC10)

1. **UC1: Setup & Packages** - Built the foundational Spring Boot 3 structure enforcing rigid separation of concerns.
2. **UC2: Database Connectivity** - Configured MySQL connectivity and dynamic Hibernate DDL updates via `application.yml`.
3. **UC3: User Persistence** - Modelled the JPA `User` Entity and built out the abstract `UserRepository`.
4. **UC4: User Registration** - Engineered the Registration payload using rigid DTOs (`@Valid`) and a `GlobalExceptionHandler` allowing standard JSON error passing.
5. **UC5: Authentication** - Hardened database passwords using `BCryptPasswordEncoder` and configured dynamic JSON Web Token (JWT) issuing on Login.
6. **UC6: JWT Validation Pipeline** - Secured the microservice by building a `JwtAuthenticationFilter` (Bouncer) to intercept and parse headers, isolating the overall Spring Security Context.
7. **UC7: Note Entity Mapping** - Orchestrated the `Note` layer implementing decoupled Foreign Keys (`Long userId`) to evade recursion bugs and maximize efficiency, and set up state-flags (`isPinned`, etc.).
8. **UC8: Note Creation** - Devised a safe `POST` endpoint extracting the `Principal` JWT identity seamlessly to ensure a user can only create notes mapped directly to themselves.
9. **UC9: Note Dashboard Fetch** - Crafted a robust `GET` API fetching `List<Note>` mapped to the user, strictly protecting against IDOR attacks stringently handled automatically via the security context.
10. **UC10: Toggle Controllers** - Developed stateless `PUT` APIs enabling frontend clients to flip boolean flags for `Pin`, `Archive`, and `Trash` behaviors safely.

## 🚀 Upcoming Phases (Phase 2)
- Implementing Labeling system for generic tagging.
- Reminders scheduling framework.
